## Overview

Celeste Mobile Port runs Celeste and Everest inside a threaded .NET WebAssembly environment and surrounds that runtime with a comparatively small platform-specific host.

The Android version currently uses Mozilla GeckoView as its embedded browser engine.

Rather than attempting to rewrite Celeste as native Android or iOS game code, the project keeps nearly all game logic, Everest, mods, and FNA-compatible runtime behavior inside the shared WASM environment.

Platform wrappers provide the functionality that actually needs to be native, including:

- Touch controls
- Haptics
- Save import/export
- File access
- Mod management
- Multiplayer host services
- Platform lifecycle handling
- Native browser/runtime integration
- Platform-specific fullscreen and display behavior

The architecture is intentionally split into four major parts:

```text
Celeste-Mobile-Port/
│
├── AndroidWrapper/
├── IOSWrapper/
├── CelesteRuntime/
└── CelesteMobileMods/
```

This keeps the game runtime largely platform-independent.

The goal is for Android and iOS to share the same Celeste/Everest runtime and mobile mods while replacing only the native wrapper layer.

## Completed Android startup work

Latest package: **1.0.1-preview.5**, development-signed. Android mods and APK rebuilt;
focused browser/assembly checks pass. Physical-device regression testing remains required.

- [x] Atlas-only unlock picker; encrypted game parts and metadata bundled inside the APK.
- [x] Gameplay controls: Grab, Dash, Jump and Crouch Dash, with Pause separate.
- [x] Pause-only overlay during passive cutscenes, postcards and intro vignette; interactive tutorial prompts restore movement/action controls. Postcard taps reach the confirmation coroutine.
- [x] Floating Controls shortcut hidden by default; layout editor available in Options.
- [x] Show/always-on controls, reset layout, exclusive arrows/joystick and visible 8-way snapping.
- [x] Nearby missed gameplay touches select the nearest control.
- [x] Finger scrolling, Mod Manager dialog and native website opening (manager/link checked on emulator).
- [x] Assist Mode arrows, enable/disable selection and chapter-unlock pointer handlers implemented.
- [x] English autosave screen says phone; bundled mod labels use their proper text.
- [x] Startup filesystem error fixed; browser bridge compiled with real WASM imports.
- [x] iOS wrapper source and Mac build scripts created (see [iOS build instructions](IOSWrapper/README.md)).
- [ ] iOS compilation, signed IPA export and device validation; no IPA built on Windows.

- [x] Everest patching and initialization through `CelesteLoader.Init successful`.
- [x] FMOD initialization using update-driven mixing, streaming and bank loading.
- [x] Canonical `/libsdl/Content` path for language loading.
- [x] Disable Everest parallel texture loading that can deadlock on higher-core-count phones.
- [x] Loading overlay waits for non-black framebuffer samples instead of `GAME DISPLAYED`.
- [x] Correct SRGB8 (`0x8C41`) empty render-target allocations to SRGB8_ALPHA8. `0x8C41` is not RGB16F.
- [x] Skip the automatic Everest play/speedrun/create welcome questionnaire.
- [x] Compatible-file import with SHA-256 verification and a public APK packaging mode.
- [ ] Optional store-account verification service (Android entry requires a separately hosted service).
- [x] Release preparation: notes, tag, attachments, SHA-256 sums and an explicit draft-release command.
- [x] File-key decryption using the original `Content/Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay0.data` from an owned desktop install.
- [x] One installable APK per GitHub Release, with encrypted game data inside it. Generated APKs stay out of Git; repository files must remain below 100 MB.
- [x] Rebuilt MobileTweaks, MobileBridge and MouseUI included in the public APK.
- [x] Android setup asks only for the owned Gameplay0.data atlas; on-device decryption and verified import.
- [x] MobileTweaks English autosave notice says "Please do not turn off your phone while this icon is visible".
- [x] Bundled mobile mods load from unpacked folders; emulator reaches the main menu with all three modules registered.
- [x] Startup failures replace the loading status with the error instead of leaving "initializing" displayed.
- [ ] Confirm the latest build through gameplay on a physical Android device.
- [ ] Live Steam sign-in validation with a configured service and account.
- [ ] Convert ordinary desktop store installations into compatible WASM game files automatically.

The public APK bundles MobileTweaks, MobileBridge and MouseUI. The mod build also
rebuilds BetterMapEditor and MobileMultiplayer, which remain optional. The feature
lists describe source implementations; device validation must be checked for each release.

## Ownership and releases

The file-key route checks possession of a compatible original atlas, rather than
proving a store purchase. Store-account verification is not configured in this
build. itch.io and Epic login are not implemented.

The encrypted release is unlocked using `Gameplay0.data` from the user's desktop
install. Choose **Unlock with my game file** on Android and select that atlas.
No other files or folders need to be imported. The advanced
`game_pack.py` tool still requires an already prepared private `CelesteRuntime`.
Public APKs contain encrypted game assets, with no plaintext commercial game assemblies or Content archive.
Do not upload the normal bundled development APK or a private import ZIP.

```powershell
python scripts/prepare-release.py --manifest-only
python scripts/prepare-encrypted-assets.py --private-pack path/to/private-import.zip --key-file path/to/Content/Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay0.data
# Build Android with -PpublicPackage=true. Retain your signing key for updates.
python scripts/prepare-release.py --version 1.0.1-preview.4 --apk path/to/public-signed.apk
```

This creates a review folder under `release/`; it does not publish or create tags.

## Features

Checked items mean implemented in source. Physical-device validation is tracked
separately above; unchecked items are planned or incomplete.

### 🎮 Touch Controls

Open **Options > Mobile Controls > Resize / Move Controls** to edit the touchscreen layout. The floating Controls shortcut is hidden by default. Drag buttons, change
their size, switch between joystick and arrows, or reset the layout. Changes are
saved on the device. Full controls appear during active gameplay and hide in menus by default. Passive cutscenes, postcards and the intro vignette show only Pause. Open tutorial prompts restore movement and action controls, including up-right + Dash in the prologue. Postcards accept direct taps through their confirmation coroutine.
Options > Mobile Controls includes **On-screen controls always on** for mod UIs
that need keyboard-style navigation. Jump confirms and Dash cancels in that mode.
Gameplay actions are Grab, Dash, Jump and Crouch Dash, with a separate Pause button.

## User Interface

The mobile integration reorganizes Celeste's menus rather than adding a large collection of unrelated Everest Mod Options.

### Main Menu

The intended mobile home screen is:

```text
Climb
Multiplayer
Map Editor
Mod Manager
Options
About the Port
```

Additional third-party mods are still allowed to add main-menu entries.

If those additions overflow the available vertical space, the menu switches to a multi-column layout and places additional items to the right.

### Options

Mobile settings are integrated into Celeste's normal Options screen.

Conceptually:

```text
Options
│
├── [normal Celeste settings]
│
├── Mobile
│   ├── Haptics
│   ├── Center Camera
│   │
│   └── Mobile Controls
│       ├── Movement
│       │   ├── Joystick
│       │   └── Arrows
│       ├── 8-Way Snap
│       └── Resize / Move Controls
│
├── Multiplayer
│   ├── Host
│   ├── Join
│   ├── Username
│   └── CelesteNet settings
│
├── Saves
│   ├── Export Save
│   └── Load Save
│
└── Mods
    └── Mod Options
```

The normal Mod Options menu is intentionally preserved.

Only settings belonging to the mobile suite are relocated.

Third-party Everest mods continue to expose their settings through Mod Options normally.

```

Celeste is not being rewritten as native mobile game code.

The shared runtime remains inside WebAssembly.

Platform wrappers provide services around it.

This makes the architecture significantly more portable than tying the game runtime directly to Android APIs.

## Platform Wrappers

### Android Wrapper

Android currently provides the primary mobile host.

#### GeckoView

The Android application embeds Mozilla GeckoView.

The threaded runtime requires:

- `SharedArrayBuffer`
- WebAssembly threads
- Cross-origin isolation

GeckoView provides the browser/runtime capabilities needed to run the threaded Celeste WASM environment while remaining embedded directly inside the Android application.

Celeste therefore runs inside the application rather than opening in an external browser.

And yes, we actually love Mozilla — GeckoView is what makes the multithreaded runtime practical here. ❤️🦊

#### Native Responsibilities

The Android wrapper is responsible for services such as:

- Creating the application window
- Landscape orientation
- Immersive/fullscreen Android behavior
- Creating GeckoView
- Creating the Gecko runtime/session
- Hosting the local runtime
- Native lifecycle handling
- Native haptics
- Storage integration
- Save import/export
- File access
- Mod-management support
- Multiplayer host services
- Native bridge functionality

### iOS Wrapper

`IOSWrapper/` contains an **experimental, uncompiled** WKWebView wrapper, CryptoKit atlas unlock, loopback asset server, XcodeGen project specification and Mac build/export script. See [IOSWrapper/README.md](IOSWrapper/README.md). This Windows workspace has no Xcode or Apple signing setup, so there is **no built IPA**.

The goal is not to maintain a separate iOS Celeste implementation.

Instead, iOS should host the same:

```text
CelesteRuntime/
CelesteMobileMods/
```

runtime used by Android while implementing equivalent native platform services.

Areas of work include:

- Embedded browser/runtime hosting
- Touch integration
- Storage
- Haptics
- Save import/export
- File access
- Mod persistence
- Multiplayer host services
- Lifecycle handling

iOS support is currently less complete than Android.

---

## Web Runtime

`CelesteRuntime/` contains the browser-facing runtime shared by the platform wrappers.

### Core Files

#### `index.html`

Initial document and runtime bootstrap.

#### `bundle.js`

Contains browser/mobile integration including:

- WASM loader behavior
- Touch controls
- Layout editing
- Save management
- File management
- Mod browser
- Haptic bridge
- Platform bridge functions
- Runtime persistence
- Mobile input behavior

#### `styles.css`

Defines web and touch-control interface styling.

#### `cfg.js`

Describes the locally supplied game-data payload.

#### `_framework/`

Contains the threaded .NET WebAssembly runtime.

#### `celeste/`

Contains locally supplied Celeste/Everest runtime assemblies.

#### `Mods/`

Contains Everest mods available to the runtime.

### Local Asset Server

The Android wrapper includes a lightweight HTTP server backed by packaged/runtime assets.

It:

- Binds only to loopback
- Selects a local port dynamically
- Serves the `CelesteRuntime/` runtime
- Supports `GET`
- Supports `HEAD`
- Sanitizes request paths
- Rejects directory traversal
- Maps required MIME types
- Streams large WASM binaries
- Provides platform-side diagnostics

The runtime is loaded from an address similar to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<random-port>/
```

### Cross-Origin Isolation

The local server provides headers such as:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: cross-origin-isolated=*
```

These provide the cross-origin isolation required by the threaded WebAssembly runtime and `SharedArrayBuffer`.

### Split-WASM Streaming

Some `dotnet.native.*.wasm` binaries are too large to package conveniently as single platform assets.

The post-processing system can split them into numbered chunks:

```text
dotnet.native.example.wasm0
dotnet.native.example.wasm1
dotnet.native.example.wasm2
dotnet.native.example.wasm3
dotnet.native.example.wasm4
```

When the browser requests:

```text
dotnet.native.example.wasm
```

the local host streams the numbered pieces sequentially as one response with:

```http
Content-Type: application/wasm
```

To GeckoView and the .NET runtime, it behaves like the original single WASM binary.

---

## Persistence

The runtime intentionally avoids persisting the entire virtual runtime filesystem.

Persisting the whole runtime through browser-backed storage caused initialization problems, so only user-relevant data is persisted explicitly.

Conceptually:

```text
Celeste runtime filesystem
          │
          ▼
   Selected persistent data
          │
          ├── Saves
          ├── Everest settings
          ├── Mods
          └── Mobile data
          │
          ▼
      IndexedDB
          │
          ▼
   Application restart
          │
          ▼
Restore into runtime filesystem
```

This keeps persistence focused on data the user actually needs.

---

## Modular Everest Components

Mobile functionality is split into independent Everest modules instead of one larger Android-specific mod.

### MobileBridge

`MobileBridge` is the low-level communication layer between Everest and the platform/browser host.

It is intentionally separated from higher-level gameplay/UI policy.

Examples of bridge services include:

- Haptics
- Platform detection
- Touch coordinates
- Tap events
- Swipe/scroll events
- Save manager requests
- Save export
- Save import
- File manager requests
- Mod browser requests
- Touch-layout editor requests
- URL handling
- Gameplay-control configuration
- Multiplayer server discovery
- Multiplayer host-service requests

Conceptually:

```text
Celeste / Everest
       │
       ▼
MobileBridge
       │
       ▼
.NET ↔ JavaScript interop
       │
       ▼
Platform wrapper
       │
       ├── Haptics
       ├── Storage
       ├── Save Manager
       ├── File Manager
       ├── Mod Manager
       ├── Touch Controls
       └── Multiplayer Services
```

Bridge calls are designed to fail gracefully when the corresponding platform implementation is unavailable.

### MouseUI

`MouseUI` adds generic mouse-based interaction to Celeste's UI.

Responsibilities include:

- Mouse menu navigation
- Clicking UI elements
- Scroll-wheel support
- Pointer-based file selection
- Pointer-based chapter selection
- Pointer-based journal navigation
- Pointer-based `TextMenu` interaction
- Replacing controller-only bottom-screen navigation hints
- Clickable `GO BACK` behavior
- Optional touch input supplied through `MobileBridge`

`MouseUI` does not require `MobileBridge` for desktop mouse functionality. It can be used seperately [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/702624).

If `MobileBridge` is present, touch is automatically treated as an additional pointer source.

### MobileTweaks

`MobileTweaks` handles mobile-specific Celeste behavior and UI policy.

Responsibilities include:

- Camera centering
- Intro/startup skipping
- Main-menu organization
- Mobile Options integration
- Browser Fullscreen suppression
- Right-column menu overflow
- Relocating mobile-suite settings
- Preserving third-party Mod Options

`MobileTweaks` does not provide low-level platform communication.

### MobileMultiplayer

`MobileMultiplayer` builds a mobile-friendly multiplayer experience around CelesteNet.

It does not replace CelesteNet's networking implementation.

Instead, it:

- Adds Multiplayer to the main menu
- Hides CelesteNet's standalone Mod Options section
- Recreates CelesteNet settings under `Options → Multiplayer`
- Replaces the normal connection/server picker with Host and Join flows
- Preserves the rest of CelesteNet's settings
- Provides username configuration
- Lists official/saved/custom/discovered servers
- Supports custom server management
- Requests native hosting through `MobileBridge`

CelesteNet remains an external dependency.

The mobile build script does not rebuild CelesteNet.

### BetterMapEditor

`BetterMapEditor` provides a standalone map-editing environment.

Its design goal is approximately:

> A smaller, easier in-game editor inspired by Lönn/Ahorn rather than a replacement for every advanced desktop mapping feature.

Responsibilities include:

- Project creation
- Everest map-mod creation
- Multiple chapters
- Multiple rooms
- Graphical room editing
- Tile editing
- Basic entities
- Spawn placement
- Pan/zoom
- Undo/redo
- Map-binary generation
- Mouse support
- Optional `MobileBridge` touch support

### Module Relationships

The modules intentionally avoid unnecessary hard dependencies.

Conceptually:

```text
                 MobileTweaks
                /      |      \
               /       |       \
              ▼        ▼        ▼
      MobileBridge  MouseUI  MobileMultiplayer
           │           │            │
           │           │            ▼
           │           │        CelesteNet
           │           │
           └──── touch ─┘


              BetterMapEditor
                    │
            optional touch via
              MobileBridge
```

Important points:

- `MouseUI` works with mouse without `MobileBridge`.
- `BetterMapEditor` works with mouse without `MobileBridge`.
- `MobileMultiplayer` uses installed CelesteNet rather than rebuilding it.
- `MobileBridge` owns native/platform communication.
- `MobileTweaks` owns the unified mobile menu experience.
- Unrelated third-party mods continue using Everest normally.

---

## Multiplayer Architecture

CelesteNet remains responsible for actual multiplayer synchronization.

`MobileMultiplayer` changes how users interact with it.

Instead of:

```text
Mod Options
└── CelesteNet
    └── Connect to...
```

the mobile interface becomes:

```text
Options
└── Multiplayer
    ├── Host
    ├── Join
    ├── Username
    └── CelesteNet settings
```

### Join

The Join screen can expose:

- Official CelesteNet server
- Existing CelesteNet server setting
- CelesteNet saved servers
- Custom servers
- Locally discovered servers
- Wrapper-discovered servers

Custom servers can be added and removed directly from the UI.

### Host

Hosting requires functionality that cannot be implemented entirely inside a browser/WASM client.

The intended route is:

```text
MobileMultiplayer
       │
       ▼
MobileBridge
       │
       ▼
AndroidWrapper / IOSWrapper
       │
       ▼
Native CelesteNet server host
```

The platform wrapper therefore handles the actual listening server process/service while the Everest mod provides the user interface and session control.

---

## Map Editor Architecture

`BetterMapEditor` stores editable project state and emits real Celeste map binaries.

A project can contain:

```text
Map Project
│
├── Chapter 1
│   ├── Room 1
│   ├── Room 2
│   └── Room 3
│
├── Chapter 2
│   ├── Room 1
│   └── Room 2
│
└── ...
```

The editor workspace is organized around:

```text
┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
│              │                                   │
│ Room list    │           Room canvas             │
│              │                                   │
│ Room 1       │   Tiles / entities / spawn        │
│ Room 2       │                                   │
│ Room 3       │                                   │
│              │                                   │
│ + New Room   │                                   │
│ - Delete     │                                   │
│              │                                   │
├──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Select | Solid | Erase | Spawn | Berry | Spring │
│ Spikes | Pan | Undo | Redo | Zoom | Save        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

It is intentionally simpler than Lönn or Ahorn but follows the same general room/canvas/tool workflow.

---

## WASM Loader Rebuild

The threaded loader is based on Mercury Workshop's Celeste WASM work.

After publishing, platform-specific post-processing can:

- Transfer the main canvas into the threaded runtime path
- Route Emscripten main-thread assembly calls correctly
- Adjust runtime limits
- Split large `dotnet.native.*.wasm` binaries
- Copy the processed runtime into `CelesteRuntime/_framework/`

The exact scripts and paths may vary as the repository is reorganized.

---

## Building Mobile Mods

The mobile mods live under:

```text
CelesteMobileMods/
```

Each code mod contains:

```text
SomeMod/
├── SomeMod.cs
├── SomeMod.csproj
├── everest.yaml
└── optional content folders
```

Examples of optional content folders include:

```text
Dialog/
Graphics/
Maps/
Loenn/
Audio/
```

### Automatic Mod Detection

`BuildDeployMods.ps1` does not maintain a hard-coded list of mobile mods.

A directory is automatically detected as a buildable mod when it contains both:

```text
everest.yaml
*.csproj
```

For example:

```text
CelesteMobileMods/
│
├── MobileBridge/
│   ├── MobileBridge.csproj
│   └── everest.yaml
│
├── MouseUI/
│   ├── MouseUI.csproj
│   └── everest.yaml
│
└── SomeFutureMod/
    ├── SomeFutureMod.csproj
    └── everest.yaml
```

`SomeFutureMod` will automatically be built on the next run.

### CelesteNet

CelesteNet is deliberately not managed by the mobile-mod build script.

The script does not:

- Build CelesteNet
- Repackage CelesteNet
- Delete CelesteNet
- Replace CelesteNet
- Deploy CelesteNet

CelesteNet should already exist in the target Everest installation.

### Mod Package Layout

Mobile mods use a flat code-mod package:

```text
MobileBridge.zip
├── everest.yaml
├── MobileBridge.dll
└── Dialog/
```

The corresponding manifest contains:

```yaml
DLL: MobileBridge.dll
```

The DLL is not placed under `/bin` inside the Everest ZIP.

The source project's normal build output can still live under:

```text
bin/
```

because that is simply where `dotnet build` writes the compiled file.

The deployment script copies the resulting DLL out of that build directory and places it at the root of the Everest package.

        │
        ▼
Post-process framework
        │
        ▼
Supply legally obtained Celeste files
        │
        ▼
Platform wrapper build
        │
        ├── Android APK
        └── iOS application
```

---

## Prerequisites

Development may require:

- Android Studio (optional)
- Android SDK
- Compatible JDK
- Gradle through the included Android wrapper
- .NET SDK
- Node.js
- WSL or Linux environment for rebuilding/post-processing the WASM runtime
- A legally obtained copy of Celeste

iOS development additionally requires the appropriate Apple development environment.

The repository does not download or distribute commercial Celeste game files.

---

## Building the Everest Mods

From the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\CelesteMobileMods\BuildDeployMods.ps1
```

The script:

1. Detects all buildable mod directories automatically.
2. Ignores CelesteNet.
3. Builds each detected `.csproj`.
4. Reads the mod's existing `everest.yaml`.
5. Copies the compiled DLL to the ZIP root.
6. Includes Everest content folders such as `Dialog/` or `Graphics/`.
7. Verifies the package.
8. Deploys it to the configured desktop Celeste installation for testing.

This is primarily a development/test deployment path.

---

## Building the Android Runtime

The exact Android build commands depend on the contents of `AndroidWrapper/`, but the general process is:

```text
CelesteRuntime/
       │
       ▼
AndroidWrapper packages runtime
       │
       ▼
Gradle build
       │
       ▼
APK
```

A typical Android wrapper build is:

```powershell
.\BuildAndroidWrapper.bat
```

`BuildAndroidWrapper.bat` stages the shared `CelesteRuntime/` folder into
`AndroidWrapper/app/src/main/assets/CelesteRuntime/` before running Gradle.

The generated APK can then be installed with:

```powershell
adb install -r <path-to-apk>
```

---

## Testing

### Desktop Everest Testing

The individual modules are designed so they can be tested on normal desktop Celeste where practical.

Examples:

- `MouseUI` works as a normal desktop mouse-navigation mod.
- `BetterMapEditor` works with mouse input.
- `MobileTweaks` can be tested against desktop Everest behavior.
- `MobileMultiplayer` can use an installed CelesteNet client.
- `MobileBridge` safely no-ops platform calls when the mobile host is absent.

### Android Testing

Launch the Android application using ADB as appropriate for the configured application ID.

Useful logcat categories include:

```bash
adb logcat CelesteAssetServer:D GeckoConsole:D GeckoRuntime:D AndroidRuntime:E *:S
```

For a clean test:

```bash
adb logcat -c
```

Then launch the application and begin log capture.

For example, if the application ID and activity are configured as `com.unlim8ted.celeste/.MainActivity`:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.unlim8ted.celeste/.MainActivity
adb logcat CelesteAssetServer:D GeckoConsole:D GeckoRuntime:D AndroidRuntime:E *:S
```

1. **Mobile UI integration**
   - Finish consistent pointer/touch support across every Celeste/Everest menu.
   - Continue refining the unified mobile Options layout.

2. **Multiplayer**
   - Finish Android-native CelesteNet hosting.
   - Add equivalent iOS host support.
   - Improve discovery and session-management UX.

3. **BetterMapEditor**
   - Expand the entity catalog.
   - Add triggers.
   - Add decals.
   - Add stylegrounds.
   - Improve selection and room-management tools.
   - Continue moving toward a lightweight Lönn-style experience.

4. **Everest compatibility**
   - Continue testing third-party mods against the threaded WASM runtime.
   - Fix assumptions that depend on desktop-only APIs or behavior.

5. **iOS**
   - Complete the iOS wrapper.
   - Implement equivalent storage, haptic, file, and multiplayer services.

6. **Mod ecosystem**
   - Continue improving browsing, installation, persistence, updating, and management of Everest mods on mobile.
